# Design-of-a-Substrate-with-UCIe-Standard-D2D-Interface


Tools Used: Cadence APD+, Xcelium, Innovus.

 - Designed a multi-die package using the UCIe ”standard package” D2D interface, integrating JTAG, I2C, and 16-bit
 GPIO with optimized bump mapping.
 - Performed substrate routing, ensuring efficient signal integrity (SI), layer configuration, and manufacturability for
 high-performance communication.
